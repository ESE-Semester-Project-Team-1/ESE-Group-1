# Truck Platoon System 
This project focused on the design and implementation of a coordinated driving system where multiple trucks operate in a leader-follower formation. This system enhances traffic efficiency, reduces fuel consumption, and improves road safety by maintaining an automated, synchronized distance between trucks.

In this project, we model and implement a real-world truck platoon. The key scenario simulated is a car-passing event, where an external vehicle attempts to pass between the platooning trucks. The system responds by:

The leader truck detecting the approaching vehicle using sensors.
Sending a message to the follower truck to adjust speed.
The follower truck reducing its speed to create a safe gap.
Once the external car has passed, the system restores the original formation.
To ensure fast communication and real-time decision-making, we explored GPU acceleration and distributed parallel system (DPS) techniques to optimize processing speed. The entire system is modeled using SysML and UML diagrams, illustrating its architecture, behavior, constraints, and interactions.

This project demonstrates the feasibility of truck platooning and serves as a prototype for autonomous fleet coordination, contributing to the future of intelligent transportation systems.


# ESE-Group-1
In this repo we included all the files regarding the semester project for ESE & DPS. The repo is organised as follows:

### 1. Homework01
This contains the pdf file for the first task in ESE which was to present examples of embedded systems with respect to ESE charachteristics.

### 2. Implementation
This contains all the source file for the simulation part. Also included are additional diagrams.

### 3. Modelling diagrams
This contains all the necessary diagrams like requirements, activity, use case, sequence, and system architecture.
